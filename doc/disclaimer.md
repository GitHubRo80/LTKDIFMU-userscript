### Who made this Userscipt ?

This custom made userscript is a fan-made project, made by peoples liking the music, and not the ads nor the imposed tracking and artificial limitations.

### How does it works ?

This Userscript works by adding custom-tailored client-side javascript upon browsing a webradio from the supported websites.

This code only executes on the browser and is mostly applying new elements to the page (for added features), and filtering others (for ads & premium banners).

The code also uses the platform's plublic Event API to hook into the system to better learn how and when to apply filters or add new elements on the page. 

### The use of this Userscript created some errors, what can I do ?

First, by using this userscript (or close enough forks) you agree this is a free experiment, and not a commercial service provided to you.

But still, volunteers can look into issues and try to help ! You always can open a new GitHib Issue on this repository to kindly ask for help. 

### What is the intended audience of this Userscript ?

It was made mostly for friends and family.
While it is provided only for private and personal use, technically, nothing is preventing any willing visitor to use it.
Free Listeners or Premium, the features are provided to enhance user experience with the audio service.
