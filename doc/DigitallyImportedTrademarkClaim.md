## Content:
Hi there,

I'm contacting you on behalf of GitHub support, because we've received a report that your repository name, digitally_imported_userscript, may use another company's registered trademark in a way likely to mislead or cause confusion between the projects. Your repository name seems to be in conflict with the registered trademark "Digitally Imported".

They've contacted us to request that the repository name be changed and all references to Digitally Imported be removed. Keep in mind that I'm simply passing along this information, and these actions and changes are not requests made directly by GitHub.

We'd like to give you a chance to respond, or to clear up the confusion by renaming the repository and removing other references to their registered name from your code. We'll follow up with you in a week. If we don't hear from you or no change is made within that time, we may need to disable the repository in accordance with our GitHub Trademark Policy, which you can find here:

https://help.github.com/articles/github-trademark-policy

Please let me know if you have any questions and I'd be happy to help!

Best, 
Peyton

Dear Support,

I would like to make a trademark violation complaint against the following user:

Username: https://github.com/lethak

Repository: https://github.com/lethak/digitally_imported_userscript

Our company: Digitally Imported, Inc.
Trademarked word: Digitally Imported
Trademark registration number: 2814807
Trademark registration office: USPTO

Description of confusion:

The user is using our registered trademark as the part of the name for his/her repository, which script contains features that actually harm our business by violating our license agreements and circumventing our advertising revenue. The use of our registered trademark, well known in the market, attracts users to his/her script.

Requested action:

We request that the user cease using our registered trademark immediately in his/her repository name or anywhere else in the repository.

Thank you for attending to this!
