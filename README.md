# Digitally Imported Userscript

This userscript is trying to minimize and block audio and visual advertisement on all the websites and radios managed by DI.



## Features

* Preventing **almost all** ads to reach your ears by bypassing them.
* Removing some over-intrusive "premium" ad menu entry, popup and panel on all pages.
* Breaking the anti-AFK system, so you can let the music run for hours without any human interaction.
* Breaking the anti-adblocker system, so you can enjoy the music with AdBlock or AdblockPlus enabled.
* Auto mute whenever an ad is playing, auto unmute when finished (just in case !).

## Supported sites

* https://di.fm
* https://classicalradio.com
* https://radiotunes.com
* https://jazzradio.com
* https://rockradio.com

Since I am only using di.fm, please consider helping by [giving feedback](https://github.com/lethak/digitally_imported_userscript/issues/5) for the other sites (what is not working, almost working, etc...)


## Installation

### First time
Load this [userscript](https://github.com/lethak/digitally_imported_userscript/raw/master/DIU.user.js) with [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) browser extension

Userscript: https://github.com/lethak/digitally_imported_userscript/raw/master/DIU.user.js

#### Update

The userscript is setup to be auto-updated via [metadata-block](https://wiki.greasespot.net/Metadata_Block).

You should not have anything to do beside asking greasemonkey or tampermonkey to check for updates; or wait for them to do it automatically.

#### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, chrome and firefox will disable greasemonkey or tampermonkey for some reasons. Please make sure they are installed and enabled before opening any issue here.

I have not managed to make the script work on mobile or tablet. If you have any clue on how to do it, please create a new issue or submit a pull request.

## Still polluted by ads ?

Let me know via the "issue" section of this repository, or submit a pull request if you know how to fix the script.

If you can afford it, please consider [becoming premium](https://www.di.fm/premium). You will get access to DI in high quality and can listen from VLC or other players.
