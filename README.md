# Digitally Imported Userscript

userscript aimed to minimize and block ads


## Features

* Removes "premium" ad popup
* Removes "premium" ad section on all pages
* Prevents **some** ads to reach your ears by bypassing them
* Auto mute when an ad is playing, auto unmute when finished
* Breaks the anti-AFK system, so you can let the music run for hours without any human interaction


## Installation

Load this [userscript](https://github.com/lethak/digitally_imported_userscript/raw/master/DIU.user.js) with [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) browser extension

## Still polluted by ads ?

Let me know via the "issue" section of this repository, or submit a pull request if you know how to fix the script.

If you can afford it, please consider [becoming premium](https://www.di.fm/premium). You will get access to DI in high quality and can listen from VLC or other players.


## Looking for maintainers

I am not listening to DI as often as I used to, please let me know if you want to be involved with this repo
