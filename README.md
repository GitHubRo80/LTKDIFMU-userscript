# Digitally Imported Userscript

userscript aimed to minimize and block ads


## Features

* Preventing **almost all** ads to reach your ears by bypassing them.
* Removing some over-intrusive "premium" ad menu entry, popup and panel on all pages.
* Breaking the anti-AFK system, so you can let the music run for hours without any human interaction.
* Breaking the anti-adblocker system, so you can enjoy the music with AdBlock or AdblockPlus enabled.
* Auto mute whenever an ad is playing, auto unmute when finished (just in case !).
