# Digitally Imported Userscript

userscript aimed to minimize and block ads


## Features

* Prevents **almost all** ads to reach your ears by bypassing them.
* Removes some over-intrusive "premium" ad menu entry, popup and panel on all pages.
* Breaks the anti-AFK system, so you can let the music run for hours without any human interaction.
* Breaks the anti-adblocker system.
* Auto mute whenever an ad is playing, auto unmute when finished (just in case !).

## Installation
